			<h2>About Myself</h2>
			<h3 style="font-family:'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'Lucida Grande', sans-serif; text-align:left">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Hey there! I am Tejas Nikumbh, a Final Year Dual Degree student at IIT Bombay. I'm currently in my last semester. I love building things. Be it Android Apps or Hardware Products or Web Apps, I simply love building something that is used (hopefully) by a lot of people. I also have developed a good amount of interest in Machine Learning off late, and keep on learning about different algorithms, their underlying math, and design techniques. I believe, that behind every great structure in the universe, is an impeccable design. This website is primarily about my Technological Endaevors. If you're interested in knowing what I love doing in life apart from Technology, check my<a href = "https://medium.com/@tejnikumbh" target="_blank"> blog</a> on medium.com Also, do checkout the <a href = "#contact">Contact</a> section. I find connecting with new people pretty awesome!</h3>

					<h4 class="notopmarg nobotmarg" >Building Technology</h4>
					<p>
						&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp To me, the ability to build things is very important.It gives you the ability to communicate and actually 'experience', your thoughts in a a way that transcends from your mind to reality. Just as an important part of art is the ability to use the brush and colors well, the ability to build products is an essential part of any Technological artistic endaevor.

					<h4 class="notopmarg nobotmarg">Algorithm Design and Analysis</h4>
					<p>
						&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Algorithms are like Poetry. I probably read this somewhere and fully agree with it. To me, there is nothing that gives a better 'Aha!' moment than understanding the Design Principles and underlying Working Mechanisms of a well constructed Algorithm. Off late , I've been enchanted with Neural Nets and Machine Learning. More about this later!

			<h3 style="font-family:'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'Lucida Grande', sans-serif; text-align:left">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp As I previously mentioned, I concentrate on two primary verticals when it comes to building skills. The first of them is the Ability to Build Things. Concretely, I've been able to build things in the following three genres over 3-4 years of my College life. I also design the UI/UX or the products I build myself. I like having the skillset of Design to Develop up until Deploy. Recently I've developed quite an Interest for Wearables and would be looking into them as and when I get time. I wish to somehow club them with my current focus area of Android. Most of my technology projects are enlisted below , fully developed by me. Continue to the next section for Algorithmic projects</h3>
