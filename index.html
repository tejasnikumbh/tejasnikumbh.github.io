			<h3 style="font-family:'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'Lucida Grande', sans-serif; text-align:left">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Hey there! I am Tejas Nikumbh, a recent graduate from IIT Bombay. I have a Dual Degree (Bachelors + Masters in 5 years) in Electrical Engineering and my thesis was based on Computing and Machine Learning. For more info about my professional achievements, click on the linkedin button at the footer of this site. This website describes more of my techincal hobby projects/ research interests. I love building stuff that creates a high level of impact.</h3>

To me, there is nothing that gives a better 'Aha!' moment than understanding the Design Principles and underlying Working Mechanisms of a well constructed Algorithm.

			<h3 style="font-family:'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'Lucida Grande', sans-serif; text-align:left">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I concentrate on two primary verticals when it comes to building skills. The first of them is the Ability to Build Things. Concretely, I've been able to build things in the following three genres over 3-4 years of my College life. I also design the UI/UX or the products I build myself. I like having the skillset of Design to Develop up until Deploy. Recently I've developed quite an Interest for Wearables and would be looking into them as and when I get time. I wish to somehow club them with my current focus area of Android. Most of my technology projects are enlisted below , fully developed by me. Continue to the next section for Algorithmic projects</h3>
